# Infectia
A C# .NET Console Game
Infectia is a C# .NET Console Game, built from scratch, using basic I/O and ASCII Graphics.

The game is based on a matrix, the play area around which you can move freely, which has been INFECTED!                Your objective is to save 'Healers', creatures that are spawned on the game matrix.
The infection rate is directly linked with the number of healers, so removing/ saving one healer will spread the infection by one layer.
You need to save all of the healers, without touching the infection, because doing so would result in -20% health.
However, the act of rescuing a healer is rewarded with +10% health!
Before going on, do keep in mind that healers spawn randomly and sometimes it is impossible to save them.
If that happens, you automatically lose and you can Quit and restart.
Once you get to all of the healers, you become invincible and the infection dies out!
